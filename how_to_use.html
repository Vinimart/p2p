                                To run our text effect generators and photo effect editors correctly, you must use our
                                site with Javascript enabled in your browser.
                            </li>

                                For all Picture to People graphic generators, you must wait for the complete page load
                                before requesting an effect calculation. Asking for a result from an incomplete page
                                usually generates an error answer. If you receive an error message about an invalid
                                effect name, for example, possibly you clicked the "Calculate effect" button while the
                                page was just partially formed.

                                For most image effects, you must upload JPG, PNG or GIF files. For each online photo
                                effect tool, there is a label just above the upload button informing which file formats
                                are allowed.

                                For most design apps, maximum upload size is 5MB. Any bigger file can be refused, so the
                                effect will not be calculated. It's important to control the individual traffic and
                                server overload. If you need, reduce your image size before uploading it to our server.

                                Apart of the file size, if you upload an image with too many pixels, it probably will be
                                reduced before the effect calculation. In this case, you will receive back an image that
                                is smaller than the one you uploaded.

                                We offer thousands of free online graphic effects. Yes, thousands! It's not an
                                overstatement. To have a better idea about the effect generators we have already
                                released, have a careful look at the bottom menu (many of that links take you to a page
                                with a big list of effects).

                                Professional level Computer Graphics effects don't come easily. In general, P2P
                                procedural effects need very memory and time intensive calculations, what is intrinsic
                                to them. Usually they take from some seconds to kind of one or two minutes to be
                                calculated, depending on the chosen effect and the input image.

                                After you ask for an effect calculation, respect the warning message that says to you
                                wait for the result. You probably will get your result in one or two minutes at most, so
                                be patient. Remember that response time also depends on your link and internet speed. If
                                you click the "back" button of your browser or refresh the page, you will lose your
                                request and will need to start again.

                                Concerning the text effects, you should know that a lot of fonts are not perfect,
                                because they have wrong or incomplete data in their original files. Possible
                                consequences are, for example, absence of lower case or upper case letters, or absence
                                of some characters. If you get any unexpected result using a font, very probably it's
                                not a P2P error. Try the same effect with some other fonts and probably you will have a
                                correct result.

                                If your language is not in the list, you still can use the online text creators, but you can get wrong results when generating texts with special letters or symbols. Furthermore, no matter Picture to People text effect tools can process the more uncommon chars of the cited languages, the softwares still depend on the font file data to know how to draw such chars. It means that if you choose a font that doesn't implement any char of your language, that char can be rendered as an empty space, a square or whatever the font data contains for that symbol (even nothing).

                                If you have problems rendering more complex texts, you can choose the Arial or Tahoma fonts, because for sure they have all characters for the fully supported languages (and most for the partially supported ones). They are not artistic or special fonts, but at least you can create the text effect with the correct spelling.

                                Several text effects don't work well with some kinds of fonts or some sizes. Anyway, every available font can be used at least with some effects giving good results. You need to use the effects to understand their behavior and find the effect/font combinations you like most. As an example, there are some effects that simply don't work with thin typographical styles (the reasons involve a lot of Math). When it's the case, be sure to choose a thick font face to get better results.

                                The bigger the image you use as input for an effect, the more time its calculation will last. Don't upload large images if you don't need they large.

                                One easy, understandable and still useful way to change the final result of an effect is to make some smart preprocessing of the input photo. Changes in bright, contrast and histogram, for example, are very simple to get and can improve drastically the final result depending on the chosen effect and the result you are looking for. The more you use the effects, the more confortable you get about what you need to make to achieve the results you want.

                                You can get very nice and even unexpected results by mixing individual effects. Think about using the output image of an effect as the input image for another one if you feel it could give you a beautiful art. It's always interesting to use the imagination and try something not obvious.
