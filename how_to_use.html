						</p>

						<p class="spaced-below-1x">
                            If you have more doubts or need some extra help, have a look at the 
                            <strong><a class="hover-color-2nd" href="https://groups.google.com/g/picturetopeople">Picture to People discussion group</a></strong>. 
                            If you can't find there an answer for your problem, post a question to get support.

						<p class="spaced-below-1x">
						    To have the best experience when using the Picture to People site, please regard these important tips
						    presented below:
						</p>

						<ul class="spaced-v-3x">
							<li class="spaced-below-2x">
							    To run our text effect generators and photo effect editors correctly, you must use our site with Javascript
							    enabled in your browser.
							</li>

							<li class="spaced-below-2x">
							    For all Picture to People graphic generators, you must wait for the complete page load before requesting an
							    effect calculation. Asking for a result from an incomplete page usually generates an error answer. If you
							    receive an error message about an invalid effect name, for example, possibly you clicked the "Calculate
							    effect" button while the page was just partially formed.
							</li>

							<li class="spaced-below-2x">
							    For most image effects, you must upload JPG, PNG or GIF files. For each online photo effect tool, there is a
							    label just above the upload button informing which file formats are allowed.
							</li>

							<li class="spaced-below-2x">
							    For most design apps, maximum upload size is 5MB. Any bigger file can be refused, so the effect will not be
							    calculated. It's important to control the individual traffic and server overload. If you need, reduce your
							    image size before uploading it to our server.
							</li>

							<li class="spaced-below-2x">
							    Apart of the file size, if you upload an image with too many pixels, it probably will be reduced before the
							    effect calculation. In this case, you will receive back an image that is smaller than the one you uploaded.
							</li>

							<li class="spaced-below-2x">
							    We offer thousands of free online graphic effects. Yes, thousands! It's not an overstatement. To have a
							    better idea about the effect generators we have already released, have a careful look at the bottom menu
							    (many of that links take you to a page with a big list of effects).
							</li>

							<li class="spaced-below-2x">
							    Professional level Computer Graphics effects don't come easily. In general, P2P procedural effects need very
							    memory and time intensive calculations, what is intrinsic to them. Usually they take from some seconds to
							    kind of one or two minutes to be calculated, depending on the chosen effect and the input image.
							</li>

							<li class="spaced-below-2x">
							    After you ask for an effect calculation, respect the warning message that says to you wait for the result.
							    You probably will get your result in one or two minutes at most, so be patient. Remember that response time
							    also depends on your link and internet speed. If you click the "back" button of your browser or refresh the
							    page, you will lose your request and will need to start again.
							</li>

							<li class="spaced-below-2x">
							    Concerning the text effects, you should know that a lot of fonts are not perfect, because they have wrong or
							    incomplete data in their original files. Possible consequences are, for example, absence of lower case or
							    upper case letters, or absence of some characters. If you get any unexpected result using a font, very
							    probably it's not a P2P error. Try the same effect with some other fonts and probably you will have a correct
							    result.
							</li>

							<li class="spaced-below-1x">
							    When you go to use a text effect generator, your language can be relevant. Below there is the list of
							    languagues that are fully supported by our online text makers:

                                If your language is not in the list, you still can use the online text creators, but you
                                can get wrong results when generating texts with special letters or symbols.
                                Furthermore, no matter Picture to People text effect tools can process the more uncommon
                                chars of the cited languages, the softwares still depend on the font file data to know
                                how to draw such chars. It means that if you choose a font that doesn't implement any
                                char of your language, that char can be rendered as an empty space, a square or whatever
                                the font data contains for that symbol (even nothing).
                            </li>

                            <li class="spaced-below-2x">
                                If you have problems rendering more complex texts, you can choose the Arial or Tahoma
                                fonts, because for sure they have all characters for the fully supported languages (and
                                most for the partially supported ones). They are not artistic or special fonts, but at
                                least you can create the text effect with the correct spelling.
                            </li>

                            <li class="spaced-below-2x">
                                Several text effects don't work well with some kinds of fonts or some sizes. Anyway,
                                every available font can be used at least with some effects giving good results. You
                                need to use the effects to understand their behavior and find the effect/font
                                combinations you like most. As an example, there are some effects that simply don't work
                                with thin typographical styles (the reasons involve a lot of Math). When it's the case,
                                be sure to choose a thick font face to get better results.
                            </li>

                            <li class="spaced-below-2x">
                                The bigger the image you use as input for an effect, the more time its calculation will
                                last. Don't upload large images if you don't need they large.
                            </li>

                            <li class="spaced-below-2x">
                                One easy, understandable and still useful way to change the final result of an effect is
                                to make some smart preprocessing of the input photo. Changes in bright, contrast and
                                histogram, for example, are very simple to get and can improve drastically the final
                                result depending on the chosen effect and the result you are looking for. The more you
                                use the effects, the more confortable you get about what you need to make to achieve the
                                results you want.
                            </li>

                            <li class="spaced-below-2x">
                                You can get very nice and even unexpected results by mixing individual effects. Think
                                about using the output image of an effect as the input image for another one if you feel
                                it could give you a beautiful art. It's always interesting to use the imagination and
                                try something not obvious.
                            </li>

                            <li class="spaced-below-2x">
                                Since we offer a huge number of text effects and most of them can be used with more than
                                400 different font faces, sometimes it can be a little tricky to find the best options
                                to your needs. You could get suggestions of interesting text designs or logos by having
